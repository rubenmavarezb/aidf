# AIDF Integration

This project uses AIDF (AI-Integrated Development Framework) for structured AI-assisted development.

## Context Loading

When working on this project:

1. **Always read `.ai/AGENTS.md`** first for:
   - Project overview and architecture
   - Technology stack and conventions
   - Quality standards and boundaries
   - Available commands

2. This is your **primary source of truth** for how the project works.

## Task Execution

When asked to execute a task file from `.ai/tasks/`:

1. **Read the task file completely** before starting
2. **Load the suggested role** from `.ai/roles/{role}.md`
3. **STRICTLY follow the Scope section:**
   - ✅ Only modify files matching `Allowed` patterns
   - ❌ Never touch files matching `Forbidden` patterns
   - ⚠️ Ask before modifying `Ask Before` files
4. **Implement the Requirements** as specified
5. **Verify each Definition of Done item** before completing
6. **Update task status** when done:
   - Add `## Status: ✅ COMPLETED` with date
   - Or `## Status: ⚠️ BLOCKED` with reason if stuck

## Role Behavior

When a role file is loaded from `.ai/roles/`, adopt:

- The **Identity** section as your persona
- The **Expertise** areas as your knowledge focus
- The **Constraints** as hard rules you cannot break
- The **Quality Criteria** as your success metrics

## Completion Signals

Use these signals to communicate status:

- `<TASK_COMPLETE>` - All Definition of Done items are met
- `<BLOCKED: reason>` - Cannot proceed, explain why
- `<SCOPE_VIOLATION: file>` - Attempted to modify forbidden file

## Important Rules

1. **Never modify without reading AGENTS.md** - Context first, always
2. **Scope is law** - If a file isn't in Allowed, don't touch it
3. **Definition of Done is objective** - Don't claim done until ALL items pass
4. **Document blockers** - If stuck, explain clearly what's needed
5. **Follow conventions** - Code style, naming, patterns from AGENTS.md
