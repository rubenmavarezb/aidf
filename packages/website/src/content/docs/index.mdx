## Why AIDF?

AI assistants are powerful but context-blind. They don't know your architecture, conventions, or boundaries. AIDF fixes that.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Structured Context" icon="document">
    Define your project's architecture, conventions, and boundaries in a single `AGENTS.md` file that any AI assistant can understand.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Automated Execution" icon="rocket">
    Run tasks autonomously with scope enforcement, validation, auto-commit, and real-time status tracking via the CLI.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Safety Built In" icon="approve-check-circle">
    Explicit scope control prevents accidental changes. Forbidden paths, allowed paths, and Definition of Done criteria keep AI focused.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tool Agnostic" icon="puzzle">
    Works with Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, or any LLM. The value is in the structured context, not the tool.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install the CLI
npm install -g aidf

# Initialize AIDF in your project
aidf init

# Create and run a task
aidf task create "Add login form component"
aidf run .ai/tasks/add-login-form.md
```
